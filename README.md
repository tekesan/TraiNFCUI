<p align="justify"> #TraiNFC #OUR IDEA : A commuter line train ticket application that uses NFC on smartphones instead of electronic/RFID card. #BENEFITS : More efficient than cards. No need to buy cards, no need to top-up your card balance, only a simple online/phone transaction to top-up your TraiNFC balance and you can simply use your smartphone as a commuter line train ticket. More secure, because through this application, Authentication, Authorization and Accounting of the passengers are possible. More environmentally friendly. The use of NFC on smartphones instead of cards can minimalize the number of waste produced from the ticketing activity. #BACKGROUND : As we all can see, the commuter line train is currently one of the main transportation used by commuters around JABODETABEK. Based on the data taken from the official website of PT. KAI Commuter Jabodetabek (KCJ), http://www.krl.co.id/, in 2016, -in average- 850.000 commuters use the commuter line train per day on weekdays. An electronic/RFID card is now used as a ticket/boarding pass of the passengers -we also heard from news that NFC based ticketing is being developed, but we haven't heard the progress about this news, and we haven't see any people use their smartphones as the commuter line ticket-. With the great number of passengers, this method of ticketing is not efficient and not secure. One person, one card (possibly more), with no clear authentication, authorization and accounting on who buys the ticket, who uses the ticket, who refunds the security costs, we think that it is neither efficient nor secure solution for ticketing. The great number of passengers with great numbers of cards can also produce huge number of trash. We don't think this kind of ticketing system good for our country's future. Therefore, we are trying to provide a more efficient, secure, and environmentally friendly solution through TraiNFC. </p>

Please keep in mind that this project is currently and still under process, any kind of help would be appreciated
